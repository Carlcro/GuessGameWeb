          Start with each player writing a word. It can be any word you like.
        </p>

          When the players are done, the words are displayed for both.

          The objective now is for the players to come up with a word that they
          "feel" lie between the words written. Both players submit their
          contribution. If both players writes the same word the game ends and
          both players win.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          If the words are not the same, the game continues with the two new
          words. The players now have to come up with a word that lie between
          those.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          The game continues like this until both players write the same word.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          If you feel that both players wrote the same word but with a slight
          spelling difference or a synonym, you can press "end", and the game
          will still be saved in history
        </p>

          Try not to overthink it too much. If you get stuck just throw
          something out there, even if it doesn't make much sense âœ¨.
